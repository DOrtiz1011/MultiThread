    /*
     * Using the codebase provided below please create a multi-threaded application based on the following:
     * 
     * Synopsis:
     *      A multi-threaded application with two threads; primary and secondary. The application will copy an input list 
     *      of data to an output list in a timed manner (secondary thread), while the primary thread displays the copied 
     *      data as it is copied from the input list to the output list.
     *      
     * APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS:
     *      Using the two Lists provided below create a multi-threaded application using the following requirements
     *      (order of items below is for discussion only, please see code below for variables noted)
     *      
     *      1.
     *      The application MUST create a secondary thread to process input data (input thread)
     *      
     *          INPUT THREAD REQUIREMENTS:
     *          
     *           a. The input thread WILL copy each string from the _inputList and place it 
     *              in the _outputList at the same position the string was found in the _inputList.
     *                      Source Data List: _inputList
     *                      Output Data List: _outputList
     * 
     *           b. The input thread WILL copy data from the beginning of the _inputList (i.e. index zero (0))
     *           
     *           c. There MUST be a 5 second delay between the time when a line is copied from the 
     *              input list to the output list. (e.g. Copy line 1 wait 5 seconds copy line 2, ..., etc.)
     *              
     *           d. The input thread MAY NOT be "contained" in the primary thread's method via lamdas/closures
     * 
     *      2.
     *      ALL created threads MUST end prior to the primary thread exiting
     * 
     *      3.
     *      The primary thread MUST display the strings of data as they are placed on the _outputList without delay ("real time")
     * 
     *      4.
     *      All lines of data must be displayed by the primary thread prior to application exit (see Expected Final Output below)
     * 
     *      5. 
     *      The primary thread MAY NOT use the known 5 second delay noted in #2 above 
     *      OR the known number of lines in the input list to assist in determining when to end
     *      (e.g. The primary thread must operate in a manner where the delay length and data size is unknown)
     *
     *
     * Expected Final Output
     *      String 1 
     *      String 2
     *      String 3
     *      String 4
     *      String 5
